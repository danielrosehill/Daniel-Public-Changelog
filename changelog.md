# 27-07-24

- Created this changelog!
- Created a repository for Github optimisation [here](https://github.com/danielrosehill/Github-Optimisation). The purpose of this repository is to gather together scripts and ideas for organising a sprawling Github repository as I think of them. The repository will contain a mixture of ChatGPT outputs and my own notes.
