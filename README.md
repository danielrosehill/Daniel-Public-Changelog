# About This Repository

I created this Github repository as a way of creating a running log (ie, changelog) of the various technical projects I'm currently working on.

The changelog is at `changelog.md`.

Dates are formatted according to European conventions (dd-mm-yyyy).

An index of my Github account (guide to repos but not organised by date) is available [here](https://github.com/danielrosehill/My-Github-Repo-Index).
